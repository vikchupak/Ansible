### **Modules vs Collections in Ansible**

In Ansible, both **modules** and **collections** are essential concepts, but they serve different purposes in how tasks and resources are organized and reused. Here's a breakdown of their differences and how they relate to each other.

## Modules doc
- https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/collections/index_module.html

## Plugins doc
- https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/collections/all_plugins.html

Every module and plugin is part of a collection
- `<namespace>.<collection>.<module>`
- `<namespace>.<collection>.<plugin>`

So, we can ref to module/plugin using `module/plugin name` or `Fully Qualified Collection Name (FQCN)` - to specify exact source of module/plugin to avoid name conflicts, like `ansible.builtin.shell` and `community.general.shell`.

### **Modules**
**Definition**:  
A **module** is a single, standalone unit of work in Ansible. It performs a specific task, like installing a package, managing a service, copying a file, or interacting with a cloud provider's API.

**Key Characteristics**:
- **Single Function**: A module typically does one thing, such as managing packages (`apt`, `yum`), creating files (`copy`, `template`), or managing services (`service`).
- **Direct Execution**: Modules are invoked within **tasks** in playbooks or roles.
- **Standardized Input/Output**: Modules accept inputs (parameters) and return outputs in a standard format (usually JSON).
- **Core and Custom**: There are **core modules** provided by Ansible (like `apt`, `yum`, `copy`, etc.), and you can also write **custom modules** to perform specialized actions.

**Example** of using a module in a task:
```yaml
- name: Install Apache web server
  apt:
    name: apache2
    state: present
```

Here, `apt` is a module that installs a package (in this case, Apache). It takes parameters like the `name` of the package and its `state` (present or absent).

### **Collections**
**Definition**:  
A **collection** is a bundle or grouping of Ansible content, including `modules, plugins, roles, playbooks, and documentation`. Collections allow for easier distribution, versioning, and reuse of Ansible content.

**Key Characteristics**:
- **Content Grouping**: A collection can contain many modules, plugins, roles, and even playbooks. Essentially, a collection is a package that encapsulates a set of related Ansible content.
- **Distribution**: Collections can be shared, downloaded, and installed through Ansible’s package manager (using `ansible-galaxy`).
- **Scalability and Modularity**: Collections help organize and scale Ansible’s vast ecosystem. Instead of having everything in one place, you can modularize and distribute related sets of content.

**Example**:  
An example of a collection could be `ansible.builtin`, which contains a set of core Ansible modules (like `apt`, `yum`, `copy`, etc.), or `community.general`, which provides a set of community-developed modules.

To use a collection in your playbook, you'd first install it using `ansible-galaxy`:
```bash
ansible-galaxy collection install community.general
```

Then you can use modules from the collection in your playbook:
```yaml
- name: Use a module from the community.general collection
  community.general.s3:
    bucket: my-bucket
    object: /path/to/file
    src: /local/file
    mode: put
```

Here, `community.general.s3` is a module from the `community.general` collection, which provides AWS S3-related modules.

### **Differences Between Modules and Collections**

| Feature                | **Modules**                                | **Collections**                               |
|------------------------|--------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| **Purpose**            | Perform specific tasks (e.g., install a package, configure a service). | Bundle of related Ansible content (modules, roles, plugins, etc.). |
| **Granularity**        | Single units of work.                     | Grouping of multiple pieces of Ansible content. |
| **Scope**              | Focuses on one task or operation.         | Provides broader functionality, often related to a specific technology or provider. |
| **Example**            | `apt`, `yum`, `copy`, `service`.           | `community.general`, `ansible.builtin`, `aws.aws_cli`. |
| **Installation**       | No installation needed (pre-installed or custom-defined). | Installed via `ansible-galaxy` or another package manager. |
| **Usage**              | Invoked directly in playbooks or roles.   | Contains modules (and potentially other content) that can be used in playbooks. |

---

### **How They Work Together**
- **Modules** can exist within **collections**, but they do not depend on them.
- A collection groups related modules and other Ansible content for easier distribution and reuse.
- When you use a module from a collection, you refer to it by the collection's namespace (e.g., `community.general.s3`).

---

### **Benefits of Using Collections**

1. **Organization and Modularity**:  
   Collections make it easier to organize related content, like grouping modules for a particular cloud provider (e.g., AWS, Azure) or technology (e.g., networking, storage).
   
2. **Versioning and Distribution**:  
   Collections allow for versioning, making it easier to track changes and updates. You can install, update, and manage collections independently of your playbooks.

3. **Shared Community Contributions**:  
   Collections make it easier to share and download content from the Ansible community (via `ansible-galaxy`). This helps with extending functionality without reinventing the wheel.

4. **Consistency Across Playbooks**:  
   By bundling related content in collections, you can ensure that all tasks, roles, and modules work seamlessly together.

---

### **Conclusion**

- **Modules** are the fundamental units that execute specific tasks, and they can be part of larger content distributions called **collections**.
- **Collections** are a way to group related content (modules, roles, plugins) and provide a more scalable and reusable method of managing Ansible resources.
- **Modules** are executed directly in playbooks, while **collections** provide the structure for distributing and using many modules and other content.

# Ansible galaxy

- https://galaxy.ansible.com/ui/

Ansible Galaxy is a **community hub and REPOSITORY** where you can find, download, and share Ansible content like roles, collections, and plugins.

`ansible-galaxy` is a **command-line tool** that comes with Ansible, used to manage Ansible content from Ansible Galaxy.
